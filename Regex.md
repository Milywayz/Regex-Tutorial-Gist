# Regex Tutorial Gist

This gist will be all about better understanding what a Regex is and the purpose of a Regex. I will talk about a specific Regex that I will find useful to know about for future use and hopefully you as well.

## Summary

I will be explaining a "Matching an Email" Regex, which will include a better understanding of each component of the Regex and what use you can have with it.
Matching an Email Regex code looks like this: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
